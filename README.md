# TEAM ROBOCON MJCET-2020



The theme was "Robo Rugby 7S". 2 Robots were to be developed both mannual. Passing Robot a.k.a. PR passes the rugby ball from the rack to Try Robot a.k.a. TR which avoids poles and tries (grounds the ball in the try spots). Once the try is done the PR kicks the ball into the goal post.

**Specifications of Passing robot(PR): -**
* Operating Voltage: 24V
* The Locomotion is achieved by interfacing the PS2 Controller joystick with the microcontroller.
* The MicroController is mounted onto the PCB (designed using Cadsoft EAGLE).
* For the steering mechanism was controlled with only one motor for all the four wheels and the driving mechnism was controlled by a wheel attached to a motor. 
* Rotary encoders are used as feedback from the motors for improved precision for passing and kicking.
* For passing mechanism, the claw was actuated by a pneumatic piston and the ball was throwed.
* For kicking mechanism, the rod simply rotates and hit it the ball.


**Specifications of Try Robot(TR): -**
* Operating Voltage: 24V
* The Locomotion is achieved by interfacing the PS2 Controller joystick with the microcontroller.
* The MicroController is mounted onto the PCB (designed using Cadsoft EAGLE).
* For the steering mechanism was controlled with only one motor for all the four wheels and the driving mechnism was controlled by a wheel attached to a motor. 
* The servo motor attached with a string that opens the vent which release the ball on the Try spot.
